# Swarm

Fan out N parallel background workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers. All N run on this machine, so a large N shares its CPU, memory, ports, and API rate limits. Batch the spawns when the machine or the limits cannot take N at once.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` model role, resolved per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/poteto-mode/references/model-roles.md`. With no configured line, use `sonnet/high`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. A `codex` arm, such as `codex/high`, is a Codex slot.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes, and its own ports, `/tmp` subdirectory, and test data when it runs the app, since workers share this machine. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with the `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `run_in_background: true`, and the step 4 model and effort. A worker that checks out code, builds, or writes in the repository also gets `isolation: "worktree"`. Read-only workers that only inspect the current checkout skip isolation.

A worktree starts from the repository's default branch. When a worker must start from another branch or SHA, its brief names it, and the worker checks it out and confirms `git rev-parse HEAD` before doing anything else.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
